Explainable AI for Customer Churn Prediction Using Hybrid ML Model
📖 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a crucial task for organizations aiming to improve retention and reduce revenue loss.
This project builds an Explainable Hybrid Machine Learning Model combining XGBoost and Sequence-based trend learning to accurately identify customers likely to churn.
The system integrates Explainable AI (SHAP & LIME), AutoML-driven feature selection, an interactive Streamlit dashboard, and a standalone Windows EXE for easy deployment.
